## Open Logseq in VS Code

This plugin offers quick access of following in VS Code 
- focused blocks or pages
- configuration files
- the graph folder

![demo](./demo.gif)

VS Codium is also supported.
 
## Usage

Use the following keyboard shortcuts:
- `mod+shift+o`: Open graph
- `mod+o`: Open current page
- `mod+alt+o`: Open current block

You can also use the command palette to execute these commands.

Note: Logseq's `ctrl+d ctrl+a` shortcut opens the current page in the default app.

## Options
### Editor Options
Specify the version of VS Code (or, URL scheme) you're using. 
- Stable : `vscode://file/`
- Insider : `vscode-insiders://file/`
- VS Codium : `vscodium://file/`

Though not planed, this list can potentially be extended to other editors that support file URLs.

### Window options
By default, a new windows will be opened. But sometimes it's preferable to avoid reopening a new windows for each file. So several options are provided.

Choose where to open the specified file
- In an independent new window
- In the last focused window
- In the graph folder
- In the workspace (Experimental function. It only works when the file `<graph folder>/<graph_name>.code-workspace` exists. And it's only tested with the stable version)

> Right now the path of the file `<graph_name>.code-workspace` has to be put in the graph folder. And it's highly recommended to enable automatic saving on focus change. 
> ```json
>{
>	"folders": [
>		{
>			"path": "."
>		}
>	],
>	"settings": {
>		"files.autoSave": "onFocusChange", // recommended
>	}
>}
> ```

## Development
