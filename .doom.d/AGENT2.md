# Testing Agent for Stata Sixel Integration Fix

## Mission
Test the fixed Stata sixel integration to verify inline graphics display works correctly.

## Context
Two fixes have been implemented:
1. **Emacs Fix**: Updated `jupyter-termint-display-image-inline` to use actual img2sixel conversion instead of Emacs image insertion
2. **Stata Fix**: Enhanced Stata configuration to display sixel graphics directly within jupyter console process (following R pattern)

## Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Emacs Configuration Testing
1. Check if Emacs daemon is running and restart if needed
2. Test emacsclient function availability for jupyter-termint functions
3. Verify jupyter-termint.el loads without errors

### Phase 2: Stata Console Testing  
1. Create Stata org-src buffer with test code: `s price mpg` 
2. Use C-RET to send code to *jupyter-stata* buffer
3. Verify *jupyter-stata* buffer is created in right split
4. Monitor console output for sixel display 

### Phase 3: Sixel Display Verification
1. Check if PNG files are created in ~/.stata_kernel_cache/
2. Verify img2sixel is called and sixel data appears in terminal buffer
3. Take screenshots to document working inline graphics
4. Compare behavior with working R integration

### Phase 4: Results Documentation
1. Document successful inline sixel display
2. Report any remaining issues
3. Provide performance metrics and user experience assessment

## Expected Results
- Stata `s price mpg` command should display scatter plot inline in *jupyter-stata* buffer 
- No separate windows or failed conversions
- Sixel graphics appear directly in terminal output stream
- Matches R integration behavior for seamless user experience

## Commands to Use
```bash
# Check Emacs status
ps aux | grep -i emacs

# Test function availability
emacsclient --eval "(fboundp 'jupyter-termint-send-simple)"

# Take screenshots
osascript -e 'tell application "Emacs" to activate'
screencapture -T 0.5 stata-sixel-test.png

# Check file creation
ls -la ~/.stata_kernel_cache/
```

Execute comprehensive testing and report back with detailed results.
