Execute comprehensive Jupyter-Stata sixel graphics testing following the complete protocol in combined-test-instructions.md. The developer has fixed critical buffer permission and sixel display issues. Test the fixes by:

1. Fresh Emacs restart with error checking
2. Module loading verification (jupyter-stata, eat, termint functions)  
3. Single Stata scatter plot execution with sixel display verification
4. Sequential histogram plot to test persistence  
5. Buffer permission testing for modification errors
6. Screenshot capture of visual sixel graphics display
7. Window configuration verification

Expected fixes to verify:
- No "text-read-only" buffer errors 
- Actual sixel graphics visible in eat terminal buffer
- Proper terminal spacing prevents plot overwriting
- Sequential plots persist in same jupyter buffer

Log all results to ~/stata-sixel-test-results.log and capture screenshot as stata-sixel-fix-test.png. Report final PASS/FAIL status for each test component.
