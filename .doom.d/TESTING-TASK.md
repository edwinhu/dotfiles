# TASK: Comprehensive Fresh Emacs Stata Integration Test

## Objective
Execute the complete fresh Emacs testing protocol defined in AGENT1.md to verify Stata inline graphics integration works reliably from a clean startup.

## Primary Directive
Follow the testing protocol in `/Users/vwh7mb/dotfiles/.doom.d/AGENT1.md` exactly, executing all 5 phases systematically:

1. **Phase 1**: Complete fresh environment setup
2. **Phase 2**: Module loading verification  
3. **Phase 3**: Fresh jupyter integration test
4. **Phase 4**: End-to-end graphics workflow
5. **Phase 5**: Integration robustness testing

## Critical Requirements
- Execute ALL commands in the agent protocol using the Bash tool
- Take screenshots after each graphics command and resize: `sips -Z 1900 filename.png`
- Use `kill-buffer-query-functions nil` for jupyter buffer cleanup
- Log ALL results with timestamps to `/Users/vwh7mb/dotfiles/.doom.d/fresh-stata-test.log`
- Document exact error messages for any failures
- Test with completely FRESH Emacs environment - no cached state

## Success Criteria Validation
Verify ALL 10 success criteria from AGENT1.md pass:
✅ Clean startup ✅ Module loading ✅ Function availability ✅ C-RET workflow ✅ Process management ✅ File monitoring ✅ Graphics display ✅ Multiple graphics ✅ Window configuration ✅ Consistent behavior

## Expected Deliverables
1. Complete test execution log with timestamps
2. Screenshots showing split window + inline graphics for scatter, histogram, twoway plots
3. emacsclient function availability verification results
4. Buffer creation and content verification
5. Final pass/fail status with specific failure details if any

## Failure Protocol
If ANY test fails:
1. Document exact error message and failure point
2. Take screenshot of current state
3. Identify root cause (startup, loading, process, graphics, etc.)
4. Recommend specific fixes for the developer
5. Do NOT continue testing until issue is resolved

Execute this comprehensive protocol and report detailed results immediately.
