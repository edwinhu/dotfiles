# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a dotfiles repository for a macOS development environment. The configuration follows a modular approach with settings organized by tool, using symlinks from the dotfiles directory to the home directory.

## Key Commands

### System Package Management
- **Rebuild system configuration**: `cd ~/nix && nix run .#build-switch`
- System packages are managed via **nix-darwin** - always make system-level changes through the nix configuration

### Development Tools
- **Search files**: Use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of grep
- **Find files**: Use `fd` instead of find
- **GitHub operations**: Use `gh` CLI
- **Directory navigation**: `cd` is aliased to `zoxide` for smart navigation

### Important Aliases
- `yolo`: Claude AI with bypass permissions
- `y`: Launch yazi file manager
- `search`: Ripgrep excluding node_modules
- `lg`: LazyGit

## Architecture & Structure

### Configuration Organization
```
dotfiles/
├── .shell_common        # Core shell config (sourced by bash/zsh)
├── .shell_aliases       # Command aliases and functions
├── .shell_env          # Environment variables and PATH
├── .config/            # XDG-compliant configurations
│   ├── ghostty/        # Primary terminal (GPU-accelerated)
│   ├── nvim/           # Neovim (LazyVim-based)
│   └── wezterm/        # Alternative terminal
└── .doom.d/            # Doom Emacs configuration
```

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Modular shell configuration**: Separate files for env, aliases, and common settings
2. **No installation scripts**: Manual symlink approach for explicit control
3. **XDG compliance**: Configurations in `.config/` directory
4. **Consistent theming**: Catppuccin Mocha color scheme throughout

### Nix-Managed Configurations
- **Sketchybar**: Fully managed by nix-darwin in `~/nix/modules/darwin/sketchybar/`
- **Git**: Configuration managed by nix home-manager
- **SSH**: Configuration managed by nix home-manager
- **tmux**: Configuration managed by nix home-manager
- **Starship**: Prompt configuration managed by nix home-manager
- **Zoxide**: Shell navigation managed by nix home-manager

## Important Context

### Package Management
- **Python/R projects**: Use `pixi` - always check `pixi.toml` before suggesting package installations
- **System packages**: Use nix-darwin - never use homebrew or system package managers directly

### Terminal Configuration
- **Leader key**: Ctrl+S in Ghostty
- **Special keybinding**: Shift+Enter for newlines in Claude Code
- Default editor: `nvim`

### Shell Environment
- Sources nix-darwin profiles for package availability
- Works with both bash and zsh
- Custom PATH additions for user-specific directories remain in `.shell_env`

### Marimo Notebooks
- When working with marimo notebooks, check the `__marimo__` folder for the `.ipynb` file with the same filename
- These `.ipynb` files contain the inputs/outputs for debugging purposes and any relevant images
