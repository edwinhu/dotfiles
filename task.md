# Task: Test Updated Stata Sixel Implementation with Chafa

You are a testing subagent responsible for comprehensively testing the updated jupyter-termint.el Stata implementation. The key improvements to verify are:

1. **chafa instead of img2sixel**: Uses `chafa --format=sixel --size=800x600` for better sixel output
2. **Proper TERM environment**: Fixed to use `TERM=xterm-kitty COLORTERM=truecolor` (not DUMB)
3. **eat backend**: Confirmed using `:backend 'eat` (not vterm which can't display sixel)
4. **Process-based sixel sending**: Maintains fixed approach of sending sixel through terminal process

## Your Mission

Execute the complete testing protocol from AGENT1.md focusing on:
- Verifying chafa detection and usage instead of img2sixel
- Confirming proper TERM environment variables (xterm-kitty not DUMB)
- Testing eat backend terminal buffer creation
- Verifying inline sixel graphics rendering quality with chafa
- Documenting all results with screenshots

## Key Testing Steps

1. **Clean Environment**: Kill all Emacs processes, start fresh, check warnings
2. **Module Loading**: Verify jupyter-termint.el functions load correctly
3. **Buffer Creation**: Create org buffer, use C-RET to create *jupyter-stata* buffer
4. **Graphics Testing**: Execute scatter plot, verify chafa usage and inline sixel display
5. **Environment Check**: Verify TERM=xterm-kitty and COLORTERM=truecolor
6. **Documentation**: Screenshots and logs of all results

## Success Criteria

- No syntax errors on fresh Emacs startup
- jupyter-stata buffer creates successfully with eat backend  
- TERM environment is xterm-kitty (not DUMB)
- chafa is detected and used instead of img2sixel
- Graphics display as actual inline images with better quality
- Log shows "Executing chafa for sixel conversion"
- Split window layout works (org-src left, jupyter right)

## Expected Commands

Execute all commands from AGENT1.md systematically, including:
- Clean restart and warnings check
- Chafa availability verification
- Buffer creation and execution testing
- Environment variable checking
- Screenshot capture and log analysis

## Report Back

Provide comprehensive results including:
- Pass/fail status for each success criterion
- Screenshots showing the final result
- Log excerpts showing chafa usage
- Any improvements in graphics quality vs previous img2sixel
- Documentation of any failures with exact error messages

Focus especially on whether chafa is being used and if the graphics quality has improved over the previous img2sixel implementation.
